Launchpad
=========

MWM Fork of pre GPL3 version of this project. https://github.com/Nihlus/Launchpad
Needs better documentation.

An UE4-compatible game launcher

Features:

* Self-updating
* Can install, update and verify the game installation
* Basic design (I am not an artist)

Usage guide: https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?29904-Launchpad-A-free-open-source-UE4-compatible-game-launcher

Note for users installing on Unix - you may need to install some additional libraries for Launchpad to run.
Simply run /Scripts/launchpad-dependencies.sh if your system is Debian or Debian-based, and it'll install them for you.

If you are not on a Debian-based system, you have to install these packages:
* libnotify-cil-dev
* libwebkitgtk-dev
